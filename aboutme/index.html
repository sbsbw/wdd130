        <h2>Sean</h2>
        <p>     I am a computer science major. I love computers and am
           enjoying learning how to use them. I am 24 years old and
           I have been an uncle since I was 4 years old. I currently
           have 25 nieces and nephews and love them all.
        </p>
        <p>     I also have many hobbies. I enjoy play almost any
           game or sport and am a go with the flow type of guy.
           if it sounds fun, I'll be there.
        </p>
