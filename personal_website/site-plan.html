        This site has been made for ease the burden of meal choosing and/or planning for everyone. Whether you are a student that has a busy week and sometimes struggles to choose what to eat when your mind is otherwise occupied, or you are a mom just getting home from work to find out that your family has no dinner plans. Random Meal Generator has your back!
        I am Sean Walker and the creator of this website. I am a college student that is taking classes full time while at the same time, I am working part time to get myself through school with not debt. After all the time and work that I put into school, I sometimes am too tired to try and figure out what I want to eat. This is what motivated me to make this website. It is going to take a weight off my shoulders to not need to worry about choosing what to eat. Now I can use this site to simplify my choice!
        If we look at the world as it is currently, food is a huge part of our culture. Whether we feel pride for our own local foods or enjoy trying new foods while we travel, food has an impact on who we are. I hope this site can help you love food a little more and help food be part of your life.
