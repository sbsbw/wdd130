                <h2>Why I made this site?</h1>
                <p>If we look at the world as it is currently, food is a huge part of our culture. Whether we feel pride for our own local foods or enjoy trying new foods while we travel, food has an impact on who we are. I hope this site can help you love food a little more and help food be part of your life.</p>

            <h2>About me:</h1>
            <p>I am Sean Walker and the creator of this website. I am a college student that is taking classes full time while at the same time, I am working part time to get myself through school with not debt. After all the time and work that I put into school, I sometimes am too tired to try and figure out what I want to eat. This is what motivated me to make this website. It is going to take a weight off my shoulders to not need to worry about choosing what to eat. Now I can use this site to simplify my choice!</p>
